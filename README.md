# BizPocketHub — Worldwide Verified Business Directory Platform

BizPocketHub is an enterprise-grade, production-oriented, worldwide business directory platform built as a clean TypeScript monorepo with Next.js (App Router, Tailwind CSS, Server Components) and Express.js REST API with Mongoose and MongoDB.

---

## 🌟 Key Features

1. **Worldwide Directory Architecture:**
   - Standardized on ISO 3166-1 country codes and multi-branch physical locations.
   - Comprehensive category hierarchies with aggregated business counts.
   - Geo-indexed branch locations (`2dsphere`) supporting physical premises, service-area businesses, and digital-only entities.

2. **Full Listing Lifecycle & Moderation:**
   - Visitors and business owners register and submit listings.
   - Submissions enter a `pending` state; only admin-reviewed and approved listings are published to the public search index.
   - Administrative portal with live metrics, approval/rejection queues, claim verification, and security audit logs.

3. **Ownership Claims & Trust Verification:**
   - Unclaimed listings display prominent claim funnels.
   - Corporate owners submit claim evidence; administrators verify credentials before transferring ownership.
   - Verified badges backed by transparent documentation explanations.

4. **Technical SEO First:**
   - Next.js Server Components by default with HTTP 404 handling.
   - Schema.org JSON-LD structured data (`LocalBusiness`, `Organization`, `PostalAddress`, `AggregateRating`).
   - Dynamic `sitemap.ts` and `robots.ts` indexing only published, crawl-worthy profiles.
   - Canonical URL policy and breadcrumbs.

5. **Customer Reviews with Fraud Prevention:**
   - 1-to-5 star rating system with rating aggregation.
   - Strict duplicate prevention: 1 review per authenticated user per business.
   - Business owners cannot review their own listings.

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Configuration
Copy the example environment configuration:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
*(Zero-configuration ready: The backend automatically boots an embedded in-memory MongoDB engine if a local or Atlas MongoDB URI is not active).*

### 3. Build Shared Package & Seed Database
```bash
# Build the shared schemas and types
npm run build:shared

# Seed realistic fictional global listings across 7 countries
npm run seed
```

### 4. Run Development Servers
```bash
# Runs both the Express API (:5000) and Next.js Frontend (:3000) concurrently
npm run dev
```

Visit:
- **Web Directory:** [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- **API Health:** [http://localhost:5000/api/v1/health](http://localhost:5000/api/v1/health)
